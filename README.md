USER STORIES

Yoga Express is a web application that allows the user to select yoga poses and create their own yoga sequence which they can practice at home. 

The Home Page explains the premise of the site (create your own yoga sequence), and has links to the Poses page, the Yoga Sequence page, History of Yoga page, and the About page.

The Yoga Poses page has photos of many different yoga poses and their names. When you Click On an image, a desciption of the pose will appear, including metrics such as benefits and difficulty level, as well as the option to ADD the pose to your sequence. When you click the ADD button, the pose will be sent to your Yoga Secquence page. And the user will be notified that their pose was added to their sequence and a link to "See your yoga sequence" that if clicked redirects the user to the Sequence page.

Yoga Sequence page: before it is populated, this page will be very simple with only "Yoga Sequence" along the top and links to the other pages. When the user adds poses via the Poses Page, the Sequence page will become populated with yoga poses (and their photos) creating a sequence. Users will be able to click on the poses for their descriptions. Users can delete poses from the sequence, (and drag and drop the poses to change their order. // time permitting)

Yoga History page: tells a brief history of yoga. 

About page: Has photos of developers Stephen Smith and Leah Davis as well as the description of the project.
